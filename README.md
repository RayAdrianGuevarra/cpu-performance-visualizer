# 🧠 CPU Performance Visualizer

This is a simple Python project that benchmarks your computer’s CPU performance across basic computational tasks and visualizes the results.

## ⚙️ Tasks Measured
- Matrix Multiplication (using NumPy)
- Sorting Large Lists
- List Comprehension (math-heavy)

## 📊 Output
The project creates a bar chart showing the execution time of each task.

## ✅ Requirements
- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
shell


## 📌 Why This Project?
This project was built to demonstrate interest in performance optimization and system understanding — both core to Intel's mission. It’s a lightweight way to show hardware awareness even without direct hardware programming.
